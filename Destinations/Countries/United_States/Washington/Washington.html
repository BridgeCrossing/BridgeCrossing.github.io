      <p class="card-text">First time I traveled to Seattle, Washington, my first solo trip, was in August 2019. I was riding high off my new job offer at Aspen Dental Management Inc that allowed me to escape personal career purgatory with Rush University Medical Center. Upon landing, I was amazed by the sheer density of trees. It was truly the Emerald City. The first visit was just a little taste of what Washington could offer. I only had time to visit the general tourist sites in Seattle, from the Museum of Pop Culture to the Space Needle. Although I had a blast walking around the University of Washington area with my k brotha and hiking the Poo Poo trail with my Northwestern University Data Science Boot Camp classmate and her husband, I knew I barely scratched the surface of Washington. The vibes of my August 2019 Seattle trip can be summed up by the song below. Love my high school brother <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/c/CLUCKCLUCKKPOP" target="_blank">CLUCK CLUCK KPOP</a> for creating the groovy video.</p>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>My second trip to Seattle was with my sweet girlfriend on our first vacation together, also my first vacation since the COVID-19 pandemic started. 
      Although the downtown may not be as glamorous and clean as downtown Chicago, I was able to appreciate the coffee shops more because of her desire to seek out the decadent desserts and rich coffee. 
      The only sites I repeated from my first trip were the Space Needle and Chihuly Garden and Glass museum, both experiences that can be enjoyable as a solo traveler or as a couple. 
      The latter I must admit, was much lovelier to visit as a romantic outing, given the beautiful, intricate artwork.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>We spent the majority of the trip in Olympic National Park, starting off with Hurricane Ridge. 
      Even with dense clouds and some rain, the mountainous view was still breathtaking. Definitely worth visiting again, since we didn’t get to finish the hike due to weather. 
      Perhaps star gazing could be in the plans for a future return trip.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Day 2 through Olympic National Park took us to Lake Crescent, where we were able to opportunistically catch the biggest rainbow I’ve viewed with my eyes thus far. 
      Near the lake, we trekked through the “Moments in Time” and “Marymere Falls” trails. The former gives off a feeling of walking down the crossroads of heaven and Earth. 
      The latter was the only waterfall we saw during the whole trip, making it worth it. However, it was a tougher hike than expected for a short moment with the cascade.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Taking a break from the park, although unintentional (I stupidly drove past Sol Duc Falls, but fortunately she didn’t mind), 
      we drove by a small town called La Push, home of First Beach and Second Beach (actually has a Third Beach that we decided to omit). 
      I’d call them little gems in the area. Nice to visit, but can’t stay there for very long to enjoy given the crashing waves reaching high up shore.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Day 3 we hiked through the highlight of the trip (at least to me), Hoh Rainforest. 
      Among the Hall of Mosses and Spruce Nature Trail, the former’s beauty caught my attention with its sheer volume of pure green layers of soft moss. 
      Almost felt like I was in a fantasy world (not that I would know much about that).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The final day in the Olympic National Park consisted of the Quinalt Rainforest, Kalaloch Beach, and Ruby Beach. 
      The open walking space and cleanliness of Ruby beach was a perfect way to close out the nature exploration of the trip. </p>
